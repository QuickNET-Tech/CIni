[ ----- CIni Change Log ----- ]

Version 1.2.0
 - Added a second constructor taking a const char*
 - Added macro to customize buffer size
   - Define `CINI_BUFFER_SIZE` with the value of the desired buffer size before your inclusion of `CIni.h`
   - If you do not define `CINI_BUFFER_SIZE` it will be defined for you and will be set to 0xFF
 - Replaced static buffer size in call to `GetPrivateProfileStringA` with `sizeof(buf)`
 - A little less std::string
 - A fuck ton more const
 - Class instances can now be const
 - Removed tons of redundant code (particularly redundant try/catch statements)
